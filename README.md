# hand-gesture-tracker
This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand landmarks, count fingers, and recognize gestures in real-time. It can identify gestures like "Thumbs Up", "Victory", "Pointing", "Rock", and more. The system provides live feedback by displaying detected gestures and finger counts, making it ideal for interactive applications.
